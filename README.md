# 🚀 JavaScript Queue Implementation

### 📋 A Simple Yet Powerful Queue Data Structure

---

## 📝 About the Project

This project showcases a **Queue** data structure implemented in **JavaScript**, complete with core functionality and optional UI for interaction. A queue follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle, making it perfect for scenarios like task scheduling, data buffering, and more.

Key highlights:
- 🧩 **Core Operations**: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, and more.
- 🎨 **Interactive UI** (optional): Visualize your queue operations dynamically.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all devices.

---

## 🎯 Features

- **📥 Enqueue**: Add items to the rear of the queue.
- **📤 Dequeue**: Remove items from the front of the queue.
- **🔍 Peek**: View the first element without removing it.
- **⚠️ Validation**: Avoid invalid operations (e.g., dequeuing from an empty queue).
- **📊 Visualization**: See how elements flow through the queue in real time (if UI is included).

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup for structuring the project.
- **CSS**: Modern styling for aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic of the queue implementation.
